**Project Title: Forecasting USD-INR Time Series Data Through ARIMA Modeling**

**Description:**

This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive analysis of forecasting USD-INR time series data using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling techniques implemented in R. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and accurate forecasting model for the USD-INR exchange rate, enabling stakeholders to make informed financial decisions.

**Key Highlights:**

- **ARIMA Modeling:** We constructed various ARIMA models by experimenting with different sets of parameters to capture the underlying patterns and trends in the USD-INR time series data.

- **AIC Score Optimization:** To determine the optimal model, we leveraged the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score. The model with the lowest AIC score was selected as the final forecasting model, ensuring the highest predictive accuracy.

- **Diagnostic Analysis:** We conducted an in-depth analysis of Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), and Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) to assess the model's goodness-of-fit and identify any potential issues.

- **Assumption Validation:** Prior to finalizing the model, we rigorously validated the assumption of white noise through hypothesis testing. This critical step ensures the reliability and robustness of the forecasting model.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in time series forecasting, ARIMA modeling, and financial analysis. The documented code and analysis provide insights into the process of building a predictive model for currency exchange rates. Feel free to explore the code, replicate the analysis, and adapt it to other time series forecasting tasks.
